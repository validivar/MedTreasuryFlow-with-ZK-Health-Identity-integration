## 🎥 Video Production Assets

### Video Script Sections

**Hook (0:00-0:15)**
```
"Healthcare finance is broken. Manual approvals take weeks. 
Privacy is non-existent. Transparency? Forget about it. 
There has to be a better way."
```

## 📝 Talking Points for Judges

### If Asked: "Why Zero-Knowledge Proofs?"

```
"Healthcare data is sensitive. HIPAA requires strict privacy. 
Traditional systems expose staff identities during verification.

ZK proofs let staff prove 'I'm a doctor' without revealing 
'I'm Dr. Smith from X Hospital.' This protects against:
- Identity theft
- Targeted attacks
- Privacy violations
- Regulatory non-compliance

It's not just innovation—it's necessary for healthcare."
```

### If Asked: "How Is This Different?"

```
"Existing solutions focus on EITHER privacy OR transparency, 
never both. Medical records systems prioritize privacy but 
lack transparency. Traditional finance prioritizes transparency 
but violates privacy.

MedTreasuryFlow uses ZK proofs to achieve BOTH:
- Complete privacy: No PII on-chain
- Complete transparency: Full audit trail
- This is genuinely novel in healthcare finance."
```

### If Asked: "What's Next?"

```
"Three immediate priorities:

1. Integrate real zk-SNARKs (Circom/SnarkJS)
   - Replace simulation with production ZK
   
2. Mobile app for field medical teams
   - React Native implementation
   - Offline-first architecture
   
3. Pilot with real clinic
   - Partner with NGO in Africa
   - Measure actual impact
   - Gather user feedback

Long-term: Build global healthcare finance network."
```
